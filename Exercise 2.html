        <hr>
        <p>In the first episode of ‘Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War’ titled ‘The Blood Warfare,’ hollows all over 
            Japan start getting destroyed at an inexplicable pace leaving the Soul Society confused. 
            Ichigo is challenged by a formidable enemy in his hometown of Karakura, while a group of
            masked men visits Shigekuni Yamamoto-Genryuusai’s office to give him an ominous warning. 
            Here’s everything you need
            to know about the ending of ‘Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War’ episode 1. 
            At the Soul Society Department of Research and Development, the people monitoring the movement of hollows
            notice a dramatic surge in their destruction. 
            It points towards the dangerous possibility that the boundaries 
            between the world of living and soul society will be blurred in just a few days. 
            Oblivious to this development, squad 13 officers Ryunosuke and Shino are tasked to 
            monitor the situation in Karakura town.
            Although the latter is confident and fearless, the former appears haunted by the possibility that they may have to face Hollows there. Unfortunately, his worst fears are realized soon, and to make matters worse, Shino is easily knocked out by one of the enemies. Ryunosuke fails to defend himself as well and is about to be killed when Ichigo, Orihime, Sado, and Ishida not only easily defeat the hollows but also help the duo heal from their injuries.
            Ryunosuke and Shino later wake up in Ichigo’s 
            room but when they have barely discussed the event 
            that brought them together, a man suddenly enters through the window. 
            Ichigo is quick to react and kicks him outside. 
            Although he initially presumes 
            that the man is an Arrancar, he soon learns that he is facing a Quincy named Asguiaro Ebern.
            Meanwhile, the inspection of the Rukon District by squad 11 reveals 
            that the residents have mysteriously disappeared. In Karakura town, 
            Ebern continues to mock Ichigo asking him to bring out his Bankai and use 
            it on him. Although he is confident of defeating the substitute Soul Reaper, 
            Ichigo eventually leaves him dumbfounded by his incredible powers. 
            Unfortunately, just when he is about to question him, Ebern manages to flee.

        Incredible

       For years, we have waited, for 12 long years, we had long since given up hope but
       alas fate has a funny way of doing things. Bleach is finally back with a great start
        to kick-off the final arc, cannot wait for the next episode. Cannot got into too
        much detail because I don't wanna post spoilers and all but I can assure you this
        episode was worth it. It was perfectly paced, nostalgic and all around a very solid episode
        , If I were to be too specific I'd give this episode an 8.7 on IMDb if I could. This was worth 
        it, bleach is back, the hype is real,
       RIP to the fans that didn't live to see this day.

       A Beautiful Welcome Back

      This arc is going to be one wild ride. 
      The first episode blew me away with its stunning animation, amazing soundtrack, 
      and great sound effects. The art style and animation of this episode cannot be commended enough. 
      So much effort went into adapting this arc, and it shows. 3-D animation is being used now for Hollows, 
      which worked, the 3-D was well executed. Voice acting from everyone was top notch, no surprises there. 
      The new group of villains and their leader already feel like such a threat. They're mysterious and 
      menacing. Ichigo is back and I now realize just how much I missed him. I can't wait for the next 
      episode.

       The time has come..., BLEACH is officially back!

     I actually just can't believe that Bleach is actually back, after 10 years, 
     it's finally here and oh boy... 
     I think we can all agree on that, 
     The legend Tite Kubo deserve this adaptation and yeah of course we the fans also.

     I'm so excited to finally see my favorite anime Bleach last arc gets animated!

     This premier was absolutely unbelievable, 10/10 and a fantastic start to the blood warfare!

     The animation is insane, and the soundtrack is pure masterclass (Thank you maestro Shiro Sagisu)
